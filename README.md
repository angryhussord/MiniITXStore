# MiniITXStore
Project for Summer 2019 C# Class

https://online.kalacademy.com/

For this project, I'm writing an app that can be used as a store front for a web site. It's going to mirror the example Bank application given in class as we add features, a database backend, and a Web UI. The Bank starts as a console application, but we're going to convert it to use an ASP.NET MVC Web UI with full database support via Entity Framework.

The app I'm writing should follow the same basic steps as the Bank application. It'll start as a console app, will support storing transaction details, lists of items to be "purchased" and basic shopping cart. However, I'm not planning to fully implement actually spending money in this app by hooking it up to an API like Square, Paypal, etc. for payments. At least, not in this class.
